In this assignment, we were asked to implement Na√Øve Bayes document classifier and apply it to
the 20 newsgroups dataset. In this dataset, each document is a posting that was made to one of 20
different newsgroups. Multinomial event modeling is used to estimate the parameters and Laplace 
smoothing is applied in order to avoid zero probabilities. %74.8 accuracy obtanied after tuning.
Detailed report on accuracy and Confusion Matrix can be found in the report.
